# Build a survey form

Free Code Camp challenge #2.

Having been highly enthused about coffee, following my tribute page, I decided to build a survey form, garnering people's coffee opinions. The outline for this task was to implement a form with fields such as name, email, a set of radio buttons, check buttons and a submit button.

I kept the theme and typography from the tribute page, to maintain the uniformed look, of the coffee lovers website.
